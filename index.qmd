Georgia Tai is a junior engineering student at Harvey Mudd College (HMC) with an interest in computer engineering. Born and raised in Hsinchu, Taiwan, she developed a passion for electrical engineering. She is currently a Clay-Wolkin Fellow at HMC, working on an open-source verification suite for the RISC-V vector extension. Despite her current focus on verification, she also has a strong interest in hardware design and implementation. She hopes to continue developing her professional skills both inside and outside of this course.
